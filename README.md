I started out programming back in 1991 using Basic and quickly moved into C/C++ which became my language of choice.  I also program somewhat regularly in JavaScript and PHP as needed.

My primary focus in software development lands in the areas of inter-process communication, multi-threaded processing, and socket-level communication.  I am best known for building foundational layers of automation.  Developers use this foundation as a launchpad for building more complex and robust applications where speed and stability are key requirements.  My core repositories are common, radial, servicejunction, and warden.  They provide the necessary backbone for building large scale applications.  Radial in particular is an automation ecosystem that hosts interfaces (micro-services) as well as entire applications.

It has been my pleasure to work alongside and train many developers throughout the years and watch those relationships grow into friendships.
